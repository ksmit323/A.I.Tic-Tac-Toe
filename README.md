# Tic Tac Toe AI with Pygame

This is an AI program that plays Tic Tac Toe with a graphical interface implemented with Pygame. It allows you to play against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move.

## Installation

To run the program, you'll need Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer, as well as Pygame. You can install Pygame by running:
```
pip install pygame
```

Once you have Python and Pygame installed, download the source code from the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/ksmit323/A.I.Tic-Tac-Toe.git
cd A.I.Tic-Tac-Toe
```
## Usage

To start the game, run the **'runner.py'** file.

```
python runner.py
```

The game will ask you to choose whether you want to play as `X` or `O`. Once you've chosen, the game will start and display a graphical board.

To make a move, click on the square you want to place your symbol in. The AI will then make its move, and the game will continue until one player wins or the board is full.
